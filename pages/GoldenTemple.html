        <h2>About the Taj Mahal</h2>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum located in Agra, India. It was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. The Taj Mahal is widely considered to be one of the most magnificent buildings in the world and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653, taking over 20 years to build. It was built entirely out of white marble and is adorned with intricate carvings and precious stones, including the famous inlaid calligraphy.</p>
        
        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is a stunning example of Mughal architecture, which is a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. The main building is surrounded by four minarets and a beautiful garden, which includes waterways and fountains. The entrance to the complex is through a magnificent gate called the Darwaza-i rauza.</p>
        
        <h3>Symbolism</h3>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is not just a beautiful building, it also has a lot of symbolic significance. The four minarets represent the four corners of the world, the white marble symbolizes purity and innocence, and the use of precious stones represents luxury and extravagance. The intricate calligraphy on the walls is from the Quran, emphasizing the importance of religion in Mughal culture.</p>
